Voxelgarden API
======================
GitHub Repo: https://github.com/CasimirKaPazi/Voxelgarden

Introduction
------------
The Voxelgarden subgame offers multiple new possibilities in addition to Minetest's built-in API, allowing you to
add new plants to farming mod, buckets for new liquids, new stairs and custom panes.
For information on the Minetest API, visit https://github.com/minetest/minetest/blob/master/doc/lua_api.txt
Please note:
	[XYZ] refers to a section the Minetest API
	[#ABC] refers to a section in this document
	^ Explanation for line above

Bucket API
----------
The bucket API allows registering new types of buckets for non-default liquids.

	bucket.register_liquid(
		"default:lava_source",		-- Source node name
		"default:lava_flowing",		-- Flowing node name
		"bucket:bucket_lava",		-- Name to be used for bucket
		"bucket_lava.png",		-- Bucket texture (for wielditem and inventory_image)
		"Lava Bucket"			-- Bucket description
	)

Doors API
---------
The doors mod allows modders to register custom doors.

	doors.register_door(name, def)
	^ name: "Door name"
	^ def: See [#Door definition]

#Door definition
----------------
{
	description = "Door description",
	inventory_image = "mod_door_inv.png",
	groups = {group = 1},
	tiles_bottom: [Tile definition],
	^ the tiles of the door {front, side}
	node_box = regular nodebox, see [Node boxes], OPTIONAL,
	selection_box_bottom = regular nodebox, see [Node boxes], OPTIONAL,
	selection_box_top = regular nodebox, see [Node boxes], OPTIONAL,
	only_placer_can_open = true/false,
	^ If true, only placer can open the door (locked for others)
}

Farming API
-----------
The farming API allows you to easily register plants and hoes.

farming.register_stages(max_stages, name, description)
 -> Register growing stages of plants from 1 to max_stages.
 -> Returns list of registered nodes.
 -> e.g. local stages = farming.register_stages(4, "farming:wheat")
 -> use minetest.item_override to change definition afterwards.

farming.register_growing(max_stage, stages, interval, chance, lightlevel)
 -> Registers an ABM to turn each plant stage into the next one.
 -> stages is a table that can be obtained with farming.register_stages

Stairsplus API
----------
The stairs API lets you register stairs and slabs and ensures that they are registered the same way as those
delivered with minetest_game, to keep them compatible with other mods.

stairsplus.register_stair(modname, subname, recipeitem, groups, images, desc_stair, drop, sounds, sunlight)
 -> Registers a stair. Same for corner, slap, wall, panel, micro
 -> modname: Name of your mod.
 -> subname: Basically the material name (e.g. cobble) used for the stair name. Nodename pattern: "stairs:stair_subname"
 -> recipeitem: Item used in the craft recipe, e.g. "default:cobble"
 -> groups: see [Known damage and digging time defining groups]
    Please include "not_in_creative_inventory=1, not_in_craft_guide=1"
 -> images: see [Tile definition]
 -> desc_stair: used for the description field in the stair's definition
 -> drop: Drops other then then node itself.
 -> sounds: see [#Default sounds]
 -> sunlight: When true, sunlight does propagate.

stairsplus.register_stair_and_slab_and_panel_and_micro(modname, subname, recipeitem, groups, images, desc_stair, desc_corner, desc_slab, desc_wall, desc_panel, desc_micro, drop, sounds, sunlight)
 -> A wrapper for all of the above.

Default sounds
--------------
Sounds inside the default table can be used within the sounds field of node definitions.

default.node_sound_defaults()
default.node_sound_stone_defaults()
default.node_sound_dirt_defaults()
default.node_sound_sand_defaults()
default.node_sound_wood_defaults()
default.node_sound_leaves_defaults()
default.node_sound_glass_defaults()

Player API
----------
The player API can register player models and update the player's appearence

default.player_register_model(name, def)
^ Register a new model to be used by players.
 -> name: model filename such as "character.x", "foo.b3d", etc.
 -> def: See [#Model definition]

default.registered_player_models[name]
^ Get a model's definition
 -> see [#Model definition]

default.player_set_model(player, model_name)
^ Change a player's model
 -> player: PlayerRef
 -> model_name: model registered with player_register_model()

default.player_set_animation(player, anim_name [, speed])
^ Applies an animation to a player
 -> anim_name: name of the animation.
 -> speed: frames per second. If nil, default from the model is used

default.player_set_textures(player, textures)
^ Sets player textures
 -> player: PlayerRef
 -> textures: array of textures
 ^ If <textures> is nil, the default textures from the model def are used

default.player_get_animation(player)
^ Returns a table containing fields "model", "textures" and "animation".
^ Any of the fields of the returned table may be nil.
 -> player: PlayerRef

Model Definition
----------------
{
	animation_speed = 30, -- Default animation speed, in FPS.
	textures = {"character.png", }, -- Default array of textures.
	visual_size = {x=1, y=1,}, -- Used to scale the model.
	animations = {
		-- <anim_name> = { x=<start_frame>, y=<end_frame>, },
		foo = { x= 0, y=19, },
		bar = { x=20, y=39, },
		-- ...
	},
}
