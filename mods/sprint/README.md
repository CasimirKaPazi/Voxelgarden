Forked from [sprint] by GunshipPenguin

By default, sprinting will make the player travel 80% faster and 
allow him/her to jump 10% higher.

## Mod developer settings (`init.lua`)
### `sprint.SPEED`
How fast the player will move when sprinting as opposed to normal 
movement speed. 1.0 represents normal speed so 1.5 would mean that a 
sprinting player would travel 50% faster than a walking player and 
2.4 would mean that a sprinting player would travel 140% faster than 
a walking player.
