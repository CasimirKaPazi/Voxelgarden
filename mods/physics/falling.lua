-- This code is copied from builtin/game/falling.lua
-- The only change is that we delay the check for surrounding nodes.
-- As soon as this has been added to the engine this file can be removed.

-- This table is specifically ordered.
-- We don't walk diagonals, only our direct neighbors, and self.
-- Down first as likely case, but always before self. The same with sides.
-- Up must come last, so that things above self will also fall all at once.
