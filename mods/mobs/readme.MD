MOBS REDO for MINETEST

Built from PilzAdam's original Simple Mobs with additional mobs by KrupnoPavel, Zeg9, ExeterDad and AspireMint.


This mod contains the API only for adding your own mobs into the world, so please use the additional modpacks to add animals, monsters etc.

Crafts:

 - Nametag (paper, black dye, string) can be used right-click on a tamed mob to give them a name.
 - Nets can be used to right-click tamed mobs to pick them up and place inside inventory as a spawn egg.
 - Magic Lasso is similar to nets but with a better chance of picking up larger mobs.
 - Shears are used to right-click sheep and return 1-3 wool.
 - Protection Rune lets you protect tamed mobs from harm by other players
 - Mob Fence and Fence Top (to stop mobs escaping/glitching through fences)

Lucky Blocks: 9
