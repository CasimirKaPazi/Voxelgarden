Voxelgarden 0.4.13
==================

A Subgame for Minetest


Download and Install
--------------------

Download either the latest [stable release](https://github.com/CasimirKaPazi/Voxelgarden/archive/master.zip).

If you run the latest minetest you can use the [rolling release](https://github.com/CasimirKaPazi/Voxelgarden/archive/master.zip).

Unzip the archive and place the folder in your Minetest installation ```minetest/games/Voxelgarden```.


Getting Started
---------------

**Mapgen v6** is recommended. Other mapgens are only partly supported.

When you open your inventory, the **craftguide** is the red-white ring top left.

You need to find flint to craft your first stone tools. Flint deposits look similar to gravel.


Contribute
----------

Issues use the system of:

    bugs >> cleanups >> features >> nice to haves

Which means bugs are done first, then cleanups, than features, than the things nice to have. Every issue should be labeled with one of those.

This has the downside of having a few features, but the upside of having a stable and mostly bug free base to work with and little maintenance. And I prefer to have a few well done features working over many not working.

Bigger additions should work as a mod on their own. This allows easier testing, benefits a modular design and ensure that they can still be used as a mod if the feature does not get merged.
